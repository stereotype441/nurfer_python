- Know what modules are available so it won't try to quick fix "import x"
- python-extract-variable should not be written in elisp
- python-extract-variable should look for other uses of the same expr and offer to refactor them too.
- Is it possible to suggest a refactor?
- When typing something undefined, if it exists in a libaary, offer to quick fix it by importing and qualifying thename, e.g. I type "stdin.read()" and the quickfix is "import sys...sys.stdin.read()".
- Check out my crappy unit test in scope_analysis.py.  It doesn't test anything.
- Learn about "setup.py develop"
- OMG I'm renaming re in find_string_end.
